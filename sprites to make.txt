Roman Wall (Just make like a small section of a wall and ill keep repeating it, also the view is like from the top, similar to AOE type view)
10 Roman Guards (They can be the same)
So two other civilizations, Greece and Spain
for these two, need 5 different caravans each
Caravan types:
HTTP on port 80
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) on port 25
DNS (Domain name system) on port 53
FTP on port 21
SSH on port 22
These caravans have to be different colours depending on the protocol type, I guess blue for HTTP, yellow for SMTP etc
Also, on the wall will be 5 gates, each gate has two roman guards, and each gate is essentially a port e.g. port 21,22
so need the gates too

Oh, also roman caravans , things will go out of rome too
